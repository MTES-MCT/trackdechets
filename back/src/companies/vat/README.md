## About VIES (European commission SOAP Api)

- [data.europe.eu general description](https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/vies-vat-information-exchange-system?locale=en)
- [VIES FAQ](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/faq.html)
- In the case of a valid VAT number, if the name and/or address are replaced by '---', this means that the VAT number authority does not allow to disclose this information.
- There is unavailability shifts depending on the country, check [the website](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/help.html) for more informations
- We should cache the result for 24h according to the SOAP API
- If our server IP is blocked it's because they flagged us. As a consequenc, we may not increase the ratelimit to the `searchVat` client unless we are sure we won't get blocked.
- If a valid VAT number is not found, it's may be the fault of the country's TAX administration did not update their databases. VIES only fetch the countries' registries.
